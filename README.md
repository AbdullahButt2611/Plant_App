Flutter App - Save Plant And Grow Plant .<br><br>
The "Plant App" is a mobile application built using the Flutter framework that showcases a beautiful user interface (UI) for a plant store app. This repository includes all the code for the UI of the app and provides developers with a great starting point to build their own plant store application.
The UI is designed to be simple, clean, and visually appealing, allowing users to easily navigate and find their desired plants. The app features a home screen with various categories of plants such as indoor plants, outdoor plants, flower pots, and more. Users can browse the categories and select the plant they want to purchase.
<br><br>
One of the key features of the app is the ability to view the details of each plant such as the plant's name, price, and description. Users can also add plants to their cart and proceed to checkout.
Another notable feature is the ability to search for plants using keywords, making it easy for users to find what they are looking for. Additionally, the app includes a section where users can view their purchase history and track their orders.
